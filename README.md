# SentinelShield

This application provides a console-driven interface to allow for the management of IT Service Desk tickets.
It allows staff members to create accounts, sumbit IT issues (tickets) with severity levels, and assign these tickets to technicians.
It will also allow technicians to manage these tickets, changing their status and seveirty level, and after closing tickets, they will be automatically archived after 24 hours.

To run the application, please open the myDesktop facility by visiting https://mydesktop.rmit.edu.au/ and following the prompts.
Once on the workspace, launch the RMIT Desktop.
From there, open the Windows Start menu, open the Java folder, and launch the Juno IDE Atom

From the Welcome screen, click "Open a project", and navigate and select the folder containing this file.
(If you wish to retreive the lastest version of the application's project folder, navigate to http://github.com/MichailChristofis/SentinelShield in a browser, click the green "Code" button, and select "Download Zip"
After, extract the zip to a folder, and read the updated ReadMe.txt in this project folder for the latest instruction)

Once you have loaded the project in the Juno IDE Atom, select the "SentinelShield.java" file from the left sidebar, then select the large triangle "Run" button to begin executing the program

TODO: RMIT is blocking this, if anyone can work out how to get Java running in this workspace, update the ReadMe and let me know.
