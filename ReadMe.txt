# SentinelShield

This application provides a console-driven interface to allow for the management of IT Service Desk tickets.
It allows staff members to create accounts, submit IT issues (tickets) with severity levels, and assign these tickets to technicians.
It will also allow technicians to manage these tickets, changing their status and severity level, and after closing tickets, they will be automatically archived after 24 hours.

To run the application, please open the myDesktop facility by visiting https://mydesktop.rmit.edu.au/ and following the prompts.
Once on the workspace, launch the RMIT Desktop.
From there, open the Windows Start menu, type 'eclipse', and open the Eclipse IDE.

From the Eclipse IDE, click "File" from the top menu, then "Open Projects from File System".
In the modal window that presents, under the "Import source" field, click the "Directory..." button, and select the directory containing this file, and click "Finish"
At the top of the menu bar, find the green circle with the arrow key, hover over it to confirm it is the "Run" button, and click it.

You can now use the lower console of the Eclipse IDE to navigate the program.
